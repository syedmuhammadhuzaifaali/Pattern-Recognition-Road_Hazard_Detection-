## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents an **intelligent Road Hazard Detection System** that automates road surface inspections using advanced deep learning techniques. By combining a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with a **Rule-Based Meta-Learner**, our system goes beyond simple detection—it evaluates hazard severity to help civil engineers prioritize maintenance and repairs effectively.

### 🎯 Key Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Classification:** ResNet-18 based CNN for pattern recognition
- 📏 **Geometric Analysis:** OpenCV-powered dimension measurement
- ⚖️ **Severity Assessment:** Intelligent rule engine for maintenance prioritization
- 📊 **Comprehensive Reporting:** Automated CSV generation with actionable insights
- 🔄 **Real-time Validation:** Epoch-by-epoch performance tracking

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

We utilize the **RDD-2022 (China_Urban subset)** dataset for training and evaluation.

### 📥 Dataset Setup

1. **Download:** Get the dataset from [Kaggle - RDD-2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliabdelmenam/rdd-2022/data)
2. **Rename:** Change the downloaded file from `archive.zip` to `rdd-2022.zip`
3. **Upload:** Place `rdd-2022.zip` in the **root directory** of your Google Drive
4. **Process:** Our automated pipeline handles extraction and preprocessing

> ⚠️ **Important:** Ensure the file is named exactly `rdd-2022.zip` and placed in `MyDrive` root for proper synchronization.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Our system employs a sophisticated three-tier architecture:

### 1️⃣ **The Brain - CNN Classifier**
- **Model:** ResNet-18 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Classes:** Normal, Crack, Pothole
- **Output:** Classification confidence scores

### 2️⃣ **The Measurement - Meta-Learner**
- **Technology:** OpenCV contour analysis
- **Metrics:** Area (pixels), Aspect Ratio
- **Purpose:** Physical dimension quantification

### 3️⃣ **The Decision - Rule Engine**
- **Logic:** Fusion of CNN confidence + geometric features
- **Example:** Potholes > 5,000 pixels → Classified as "Severe"
- **Benefit:** Context-aware severity assessment
